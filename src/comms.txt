Bootstrap CDNs added to index.html... for now 
Basic routing done (link to all pages added to header to ease access during dev phase)

npx: create-react-app,

npm i:
react-router-dom
material-ui
nano-id
@mui/material @mui/icons-material @emotion/styled @emotion/react


things to consider:
RecipeCard, RecipeDetails (+ 404 redirect), ingredients, instructions

checklist for ingredients, instructions (checkable, deletable, re-organizable?)
unordered for ingred, ordered for instructions
rating e.g. 5/5 stars?
